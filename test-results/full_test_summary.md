## How I ran the full test suite (PowerShell)

```powershell
# From the Backend repository root
Get-ChildItem .\test -Filter *.mjs | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "\n---- RUNNING: $($_.Name) ----"; node $_.FullName }
```

Or run individual tests:

```powershell
node test/event.test.mjs
node test/user.test.mjs
# etc.
```
